# Storage Upload Solution - Final Update

## Problem Solved
We've addressed the issue with Supabase storage upload permissions and Row Level Security (RLS) policies using multiple approaches and added additional robustness to handle environment variable issues:

1. **RLS Policy Options**:
   - Original policies in `scripts/setup-storage-policies.sql`
   - Simplified policies in `scripts/simplified-storage-policies.sql`

2. **Admin Upload Bypass**:
   - Created admin upload routes that use the service role key to bypass RLS
   - Added fallback in product upload to try admin route if normal upload fails

3. **Environment Variable Check**:
   - Added `scripts/check-env.js` to verify setup

4. **Enhanced Documentation**:
   - Updated `STORAGE_ISSUES_RESOLUTION.md` with detailed instructions

## New Files Added

1. **API Endpoints**:
   - `/api/storage/admin-upload/route.js` - Bypass RLS using service role key

2. **Admin Pages**:
   - `/admin/storage-admin-test/page.jsx` - Test admin upload functionality

3. **Helper Scripts**:
   - `scripts/simplified-storage-policies.sql` - More permissive RLS policies
   - `scripts/check-env.js` - Verify environment variables

## Files Modified

1. **Product Pages**:
   - `/admin/products/new/page.jsx` - Added multi-layered upload strategy (direct → API → admin)
   - `/admin/products/[id]/edit/page.jsx` - Added multi-layered upload strategy (direct → API → admin)

2. **API Routes**:
   - `/api/storage/admin-upload/route.js` - Added robust error handling for missing environment variables

3. **Helper Libraries**:
   - `lib/storage-helpers.js` - Added checks for environment variables

4. **Dashboard**:
   - `/admin/dashboard/page.jsx` - Added link to admin storage tester

5. **Documentation**:
   - `STORAGE_ISSUES_RESOLUTION.md` - Updated with new solutions

6. **New Scripts**:
   - `scripts/reload-env.js` - Tool to verify environment variables
   - `scripts/restart-dev-server.ps1` - PowerShell script to restart server with fresh environment

## How to Use

1. **Restart with Clean Environment**:
   - Run `.\scripts\restart-dev-server.ps1` to restart the Next.js server with fresh environment variables

2. **Verify Environment Variables**:
   - Run `node scripts/reload-env.js` to verify your environment configuration

3. **Multi-layered Upload Strategy**:
   - The product pages now try three methods in sequence:
     1. Direct upload using Supabase client
     2. API upload through `/api/storage/upload`
     3. Admin upload through `/api/storage/admin-upload`

4. **RLS Policy Options**:
   - Run `scripts/simplified-storage-policies.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor for more permissive policies
   - Or use `scripts/setup-storage-policies.sql` for standard policies

## Security Notes

The service role key has admin privileges on your Supabase project. It's used in this solution for two reasons:

1. As a temporary workaround until RLS policies are configured correctly
2. As a fallback for admin users who should have upload privileges

In a production environment, you should:
- Keep the service role key secure (never expose it in client-side code)
- Implement proper RLS policies to avoid needing the service role key
- Add additional server-side validation for admin routes
